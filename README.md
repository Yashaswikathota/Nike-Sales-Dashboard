🏃‍♂️👟 ## Nike Sales Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze Nike’s sales performance across products, retailers, sales channels, time, and U.S. states. The dashboard highlights key sales metrics and uncovers patterns that help understand customer preferences, high-performing markets, and overall business trends.

📌 ### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore Nike’s sales data and build a visually engaging, insight-driven dashboard.
Using Tableau, I developed multiple views that examine:

Total Sales, Units Sold & Avg Price per Unit

Sales by Product Category

Sales by Retailer

Online vs In-Store vs Outlet Distribution

Sales Trends Over Time

Sales by U.S. State (Geospatial Map)

This dashboard uses a clean black-and-orange Nike-themed UI for intuitive navigation and strong visual storytelling.
